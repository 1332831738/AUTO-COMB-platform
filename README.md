Description:
This code (PixLocation.py) was developed to automatically identify microspheres in microscope images. The niche recognition algorithm is used to recognize the targets and record the coordinates. For each niche, the program records its coordinates and quantifies fluorescence intensity, size, and roundness. The Python program was used to run this function.
